The Average salary is for a teacher in that state. The Adjusted Salary adjusts to the mean salary across the US, for side-by-side comparison. The State Average is what the average single-employee income is for the state. The Comparison compares the average teacher's salary against the state average. When above 100 percent, the teacher is paid more than the average salaried employee in the state.
